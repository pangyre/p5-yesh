NAME
    Yesh - Yet another content management system: secure, multi-author,
    modern, flexible, friendly, Catalyst-based (alpha software). Please see
    Yesh::Manual for usage and detailed description.

VERSION
    2.9037

DESCRIPTION
    Secure
        Well, we take it seriously anyway. This is an unfinished application
        and may have security bugs; plus it is meant to be an easy to
        install, user-administered application which leaves file and basic
        system security in the hands of the user running the application.

        That said, the passwords are stored as an expensive
        Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt hash. The application supports forcing
        users to register and sign in under https. If configured correctly
        Yesh will be among the most secure, if not *the* most secure, FOSS
        (free and open source software) personal publishing application for
        the web.

    Modern
        It is highly introspective: status, documentation, underlying
        software, and database information can be examined within the
        application.

        It follows modern software standards and uses modern kits: Catalyst,
        DBIx::Class, and Template Toolkit drive Yesh.

        We will not call it 3.0 and ready for production until it has
        thorough test coverage and code documentation.

    Multi-author
        Content (articles) can be written by one or several users. Users can
        open their own content for collaboration or protect it. An editorial
        role can be given to a user who can then edit content of certain
        other users.

    Flexible
        Yesh should run on no less than three database enginesâ€”SQLite,
        MySQL, and PostgreSQLâ€”and may even run on others without changes.
        Yesh may be deployed to its native server (not recommended),
        modperl, and FastCGI (recommended) on any OS which can run Catalyst.

    Friendly
        We are grateful for feedback, patches, themes, link-backs, and
        feature requests. We want this code to be easy, bug-free, fun, and
        helpful.

    i18n
        This is "wish list" for now. It's a strong wish though. :) If you
        are interested in contributing non-English documentation
        translation, please let us know.

SYNOPSIS
     script/yesh_server.pl

HISTORY
    A prototype of this code has been in production since 2006 at
    <http://sedition.com>. The site contains mature content (no pornography
    but probably NSFW).

TO DO
    Tests.
    MySQL + Pg date formatter
        Date formatter needs to come from the DBD somehow.
        Y::S::RS::Article->_formatter knows the right thing. Getting it to
        FormFu is the trick.

    MySQL setup + mysql_read_default_file
        MySQL config creates a local mysql_read_default_file instead of
        putting the user/pass etc into the config. Chmods it to 400 or
        something.

    Flash blurbs will not stack up. Perhaps time to finally write the
    cache-key/expires/views version.
    First occurrence of a link is bold.
        This must be configurable. Or in a utilities JS which is part of a
        theme.

    Remove license history / live thingy. Let revision track it.
    Manual complete.
    Everything from the manual using it as a spec. E.g., article revision
    views and token previews.
    Move "config->{configured}" to a third config file to separate it from
    direct user interaction?
    Move the entire auto-config to a third config file?
    Provide for bulk editing via tag, author, date, parent, etc.

WISH LIST
    These are important but not first priorities.

    i18n
    Image and media management tools built-in
    WYSIWYG preview for article edits

PHILOSOPHY
    Release early and often. Favor agile cycles over stability paranoia. We
    will be responsive to feedback and bug reports. Make easy and reliable
    updating a priority so users are comfortable

    Favor correctness over backwards compatibility. Support migration where
    backwards compatibility is broken.

    Strive for real world best practices in development: the application
    will have a specification, a test plan, documentation with complete
    coverage, publicly available revision controlled code repository, full
    tests, a new test for any new bug, push-button deployment, release
    notesâ€¦ uh, eventually.

    REST where possible and sane.

    Progressive enhancement.

    Only jQuery JS in the core distribution.
